## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to buid a website, how to manage divs and how to create projects for mobile and web view using the media query. I aslo learned dedication and commitment and also that it is more essential to create stuff rather than spend hours looking at someone else making it (Tutorials). 

I am proud of the following code

```css
@media (min-width: 650px){
    .class-selector{
        attribute: changed-value;
    }
}
```
This code basically helps you to find out the actual width (or height based on the query) and change the certain attributes of the web-page based on that

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing upon HTML, CSS and JS and also complete more front-end mentor challenges so that I can become better at front-end development


### Useful resources

- [Github Solution by Abdulmuizz98](https://github.com/Abdulmuizz98/project-preview-card-component) - This basically was the solution of the challenge, it had all that I needed to complete the challenge. It came in clutch at the end when I needed to select values and was wondering why the code wasnt working properly. Thank You [Abdulmuizz98](https://github.com/Abdulmuizz98)!!

- [This Stackoverflow Article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14942081/detect-if-a-browser-in-a-mobile-device-ios-android-phone-tablet-is-used) - I liked it because it explained how to find if a device is a mobile or PC (The question itself was my answer ðŸ˜…)
